                                At twenty-nine, I found myself sitting in a therapist 
                                office, six months away from the end of my court-ordered 
                                parole. Six months after the end of a two-and-a-half-year 
                                prison sentence I served for larceny and embezzlement. This was 
                                my third visit with Kali, a blond-haired, blue-eyed recent graduate 
                                with rail-thin lips that she constantly slathered in Chapstick during 
                                our sessions. I sat across from her desk in an uncomfortable wooden 
                                chair, my legs spread slightly open, unable to cross due to the girth 
                                of my thighs. The sixty pounds that I’d shed in prison had already 
                                begun to creep back on, settling at my waist, legs, and arms, reminding 
                                me that my body was trauma’s home. The afternoon sun danced on her desk, 
                                diverting my attention from her latest inquisition.
                            </span class="myself">

                                Her pause snapped me back into the conversation. 
                                I disinterestedly responded, “I’m sorry, can you ask the question again?”
                            </span class="myself1">

                             <span class="myself2">I knew that she was more than likely referring to my own addictions, but I 
                             did not want to talk about those. Instead, I went back in time, back to a 
                             time before I knew that substances and people were not meant to be abused.</span id="myself2">
                             <span class="myself3"> <span class="mother"> <span class="brother"> <span class="uncle"> The many years my uncle, brother, and father spent in and out of prison, 
                             leaving my mother and I alone—years that robbed me of having a father, of 
                             having a stable male presence in our family.</span class="uncle"> </span class="brother"> </span class="mother"> </span class="myself3"> <span class="myself4">Years that morphed into the “I’ll 
                             just do it myself” attitude that haunts my relationships to this day. <span class="uncle1"> I thought 
                             about the shame I felt as I walked past the neighborhood bodega, eyes fixed to 
                             the ground, to avoid making eye contact with my brother who stood outside, 
                             shaking in the middle of three-day crack cocaine binge.</span class="uncle1"> </span> <br>
    
                             These were the silent losses. The things that are not talked about in the 
                             glamorization of addiction played out on your favorite television shows. Things 
                             left unspoken between family. Like opening the kitchen cabinet to find a little 
                             corner ripped off the roll of aluminum foil—my uncle used them to construct his 
                             aspirin bottle crack pipes. Cut-off straws that were useless to drink your Pepsi 
                             with made the perfect suction for inhaling poison; <span class="myself5">I would often find them discarded 
                             under the crab apple tree in front of our house. Some mornings, I would even find my 
                             uncle discarded there with them, his disheveled body wrapped around the tree, 
                             surrounded by rotten crab apples as if the poison had seeped into them, too. </span> <br>
                            
                            
                             <span class="mother1"> Addiction steals your innocence. <br>
    
                             One day my mother and I returned to our apartment to find that my uncle had stolen 
                             all the meat out of our freezer to sell for crack. Before we could make it to the 
                             front door, after a long day of work for her and school for me, our next-door neighbor 
                             leaned out of her second-floor window to describe in detail how she had watched him 
                             contort himself into a ball and squeeze through the tiny basement window.</span> His drug 
                             buddy of the day stood as lookout, nervously pacing in front of the door until my uncle 
                             emerged, arms overflowing with steaks, hamburger meat, and chicken. Then they both took 
                             off running down the street looking to offload their bounty to our unknowing neighbors. 
                             The food that was meant to feed us for the rest of the month would only keep them high 
                             for the next few hours. <span class="mother2"> My mother stood, calmly listening, dressed in her work scrubs, 
                             face weary not just from the day but from her life. <span class="myself6"> As she absorbed the scene our neighbor 
                             played out, I imagined that my mother was trying to figure out how she was going to replace
                             face weary not just from the day but from her life.</span> As she absorbed the scene our neighbor 
                             a month’s worth of food when she had already spent the last of our food stamps.<span class="myself7">I stood silently 
                             next to her giving my neighbor the side eye. Why didn’t you do something? Why didn’t you say 
                             something? I thought. She might as well have let them in the house herself. </span> </span class="mother2"><br>
                             
                             <span class="brother1">Addiction steals your trust. <br>
                             My brother did not waste time with small things like meat. Instead, he decided to steal all 
                             the television sets out of my aunt’s house one summer day while everyone was at work.</span> <span class="mother" id="mother3">I sat 
                             by as my mother cried into the telephone, promising to replace the televisions. She tried to 
                             justify his behavior: “He’s strung out!” <span class="brother2">She confided in her sister that she hoped the police 
                             would put my brother in jail so that he could “dry out.” </span class="brother2"> </span> <span class="myself8"> <span class="brother3"> My brother had been on drugs so long 
                             I could not imagine him sober; I was just thankful he hadn’t stolen any of my things this time. </span>
                             I also could not imagine loving your child so much that you wanted them to go to prison because 
                             the only other outcome you could see for them was death. </span class="myself8"><br>
                             
                             <span class="mother3">Addiction steals your motherhood. <br>
                             <span class="myself9">When I was ten or eleven, I asked my mother for a pair of brown, red, and green leather Wallabee 
                             boots for Christmas.</span> It was 1993 and Wallabees were in fashion at the time. <span class="myself10">I wanted a pair so that 
                             I could style on my classmates.</span class="mother3"> Santa had long stopped visiting our house; <span class="mother4">my mother was not going to 
                             let some white man in a suit take credit for all her hard work. </span class="mother4">Instead, I went with her to pick out 
                             the boots with the understanding that I would have to wait until Christmas morning to wear them. </span class="myself10"></span class="myself9"> <span class="myself11">With 
                             a bag containing the exact boots I picked out and begged her to get, we left the shoe store and returned 
                             home. I counted down the days to Christmas, planning all my return-to-school outfits around those boots. 
                             Christmas morning came and I rushed downstairs to open my presents. I frantically searched for the box 
                             that held the boots, but it wasn’t under the Christmas tree. It was nowhere to be found. <span class="brother4"> <span class="uncle2">My brother or 
                             my uncle—to this day, I’m not sure who—had stolen them. </span class="uncle2"> </span class="brother4">Dejected, I left the rest of the presents untouched 
                             and stomped upstairs to my room.</span>  <span class="myself12"><span class="mother5">I got angry, my mother cried, the addicts got high. That became a holiday 
                             theme for years to come.</span class="mother5"> </span><br>
                             
                             <span class="brother5"> Addiction steals your celebrations.</span class="brother5"> <br>
                                <span class="uncle3"> <span class="brother6">When my brother and uncle were not supporting their habits with our household items, they would “beat” 
                                other addicts to make their money.</span></span class="uncle3">“Beats” were fake drugs that they sold by rolling up in plastic baking 
                                soda, aspirin, or whatever else they could find in the medicine cabinet and attempting to pass it off as crack. 
                                It rarely went over well. When the person who got “beat” figured it out, as they always did, they would come 
                                knocking, screaming, searching for the high they so desperately needed. <span class="mother7">It was a 
                                common occurrence for my mother and me to be woken up by addicts in our backyard, banging wildly on our door, 
                                threatening our life if we did not give them their money back, or their drugs. <span class="brother7"> <span class="uncle4"> They would eventually skulk away 
                                when I or my mother threatened them with a 911 call, but we always feared that the next time we walked out of the door, 
                                someone my brother or uncle “beat” would be waiting in the bushes, behind a car or up the block, to beat us.</span class="uncle4"> </span class="brother6"></span class="mother6"> 
                                Night after night we nervously laid side-by-side, silently praying that the banging wouldn’t come and, if it did, that 
                                the ripped-off fiends wouldn’t follow through on their threats. <br>
    
                             <span class="myself13">Addiction steals your sleep. <br>
                               <span class="mark"> A few months after my twenty-first birthday I met Mark. He was everything that I thought I 
                              would never have. </span class="mark" id="mark"> </span>
                              <span class="mark1">He stood six-foot-two with a broad, football-player build and bright smile. His loud, animated personality made 
                              him the life of the party and drew women to him like a magnet. I was shocked when he approached me at the party 
                              and asked me to go for a ride. A few weeks later I offered up my virginity to him. A few months later I figured 
                              out what it was that made him the life of the party. Mark was a coke addict. “It’s just for fun, everybody does 
                              it,” he replied when I asked him if he was a drug addict.</span>In my gut I knew it was more than that, but I needed to 
                              believe that it wasn’t. I needed to believe that I had not chosen a replica of all the other men in my life. <br>
                              
                              <span class="mark2">When he lost his apartment, I accepted Mark’s excuse that his landlord was an asshole and bought him a couple of 
                              grams. When he “quit” his job because of an unreasonable boss, I consoled him with an eight ball.</span> When money went 
                              missing from my wallet and my car, I blamed myself, my carelessness. <span class="mark3">Nights when I could not afford a hotel room 
                              for him, I would curl myself into a ball on his chest and fall asleep to the sound of his rapid heartbeat in my car. </span>
                              Even though I had a home and a bed of my own. <span class="mark4">When my own money ran out and the fear that he would leave me kicked in, 
                              I stole money from my job.</span> Those thefts ultimately landed me in prison. <br>
    
                              <span class="uncle5"> Addiction steals your integrity. Your freedom, too. <br>
    
                              “Addiction has stolen so much from me. Money. Food. Sleep. Trust.  My freedom. But the biggest thing addiction has 
                              ever stolen from me is the opportunity to see my uncle one last time, when he lived on his own.” <br>
    
                              I tell my therapist about my uncle. How, before his addiction took over, he was a master griller who filled all our 
                              family cookouts with good food and laughter. How he made sure when I got home from school there was cooked food waiting 
                              for me. How when I did not have enough for the down payment on my first car, he did not hesitate to give me the money. 
                              Tears well up in my eyes. I flick them with a finger, and I fidget in my chair. Kali applies more Chapstick. <br>
    
                              I tell her about how, during the early years of my incarceration, he transitioned from crack to dope and, ultimately, 
                              to methadone—an attempt to become drug-free.  But years of drug abuse caused his body to swell as if the drugs had made 
                              a home in his cells, and nicotine and crack had damaged his lungs, bringing on COPD, his oxygen tank always trailed behind 
                              him—as if trying to breathe new life into a body that he’d spent a lifetime trying to destroy. </span> <span class="mother7">I beam with pride when I tell 
                              Kali that he finally moved out of my mother’s home into an efficiency apartment up the street from where we lived together 
                              before I was sentenced to my prison term. </span class="mother7"> <span class="uncle6"> It was the first time he lived alone in his life; he was forty-eight. Tears flow 
                              freely when admitting to Kali that, a week before his fiftieth birthday, Uncle Raymond took a hit of crack while alone in his 
                              apartment. That was the last high he’d experience. That hit caused him to suffer a fatal heart attack. Due to my incarceration, 
                              I was unable to attend the funeral. Ten years later I still cannot bring myself to visit his grave. My uncle died in 2010 while 
                              I was in the middle of serving my four-and-a-half-year prison sentence. <br>
    
                              Addiction is a thief of your goodbyes. <br> </span>
